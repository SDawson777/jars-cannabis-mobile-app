# Security Notes

## Vulnerability Management

### High Severity Advisories

- ✅ No high severity vulnerabilities found in `npm audit --audit-level=high --production`
- ✅ All dependencies have been reviewed and are up to date
- ✅ Package overrides configured in `package.json` to address transitive dependency issues

### Security Best Practices

- Avoid `npm audit fix --force` unless necessary; prefer explicit upgrades with changelogs linked in PR
- Use pinned versions in `package.json` for critical dependencies
- Regularly review dependency updates for security implications
- All sensitive environment variables are properly configured in `.env.example`

### Dependency Security

- All React Native and Expo dependencies are kept up to date
- Backend dependencies (Express, Prisma, etc.) are regularly updated
- No deprecated packages in production dependencies
- TypeScript and development tools are also current

### Notes

- Security audits performed: 2024
- Last updated: January 2025
- Next security review: Quarterly with dependency updates
