üåê Backend Deployment (Cloud)

Railway (Recommended)

Go to https://railway.app/

Click ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúDeploy from GitHub Repo‚Äù

Select this repo, set root to backend

Start command: npm start

Add environment variables (SENTRY_DSN, etc.) in Railway UI

Click Deploy‚Äîyour backend API will be live at https://your-app.up.railway.app

Render (Alternative)

Go to https://render.com/

Create new Web Service ‚Üí connect your repo

Root directory: backend

Build command: npm install && npm run build

Start command: npm start

Add env vars (SENTRY_DSN, etc.)

Deploy

Vercel (Frontend only)

Deploy Expo web or static frontend (does not run Express backend).

Just connect repo, use default build settings.

‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

Backend (/backend/.env ‚Äì see /backend/.env.example for defaults):

# Sentry DSN (error monitoring)

SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn

# Node environment

NODE_ENV=development

# Port (optional, defaults to 3000)

PORT=3000

# Database (optional, if using Prisma/Postgres)

DATABASE_URL=your-postgres-url

Frontend (/.env):

EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

## Sentry Setup

The app is preconfigured with Sentry for crash and error reporting. To use your own
Sentry project:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Replace the `SENTRY_DSN` value with the DSN from your Sentry project.
3. Rebuild or restart the app.

With the DSN set, runtime errors and unhandled exceptions will appear in your
Sentry dashboard under that project.

## Design Assets

Certain icons, audio cues and Lottie animations are required under `src/assets`.
The list of files lives in `scripts/expectedAssets.ts` and can be verified with
`npm run check-assets`. CI will fail if any are missing.

The repo also includes a `Terpene_Wheel_Code_Kit.zip` archive. Run
`npm run integrate-terpene-assets` to extract this kit into `assets/terpene-wheel`
when you want to use the terpene wheel module.

üß™ Testing & Quality

Lint:npm run lint (ESLint)

Format:npm run format (Prettier)

Test (backend):npm run test (Jest + Supertest)

Pre-commit hooks:Linting and formatting run automatically on commit

üõ†Ô∏è CI/CD

## How to Enable Apple Pay After Acquisition

1. Enable Apple Pay in your Apple Developer account and create a Merchant ID.
2. Replace `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `STRIPE_MERCHANT_ID` in your `.env` with production values.
3. Add the Merchant ID to the Xcode project and enable the Apple Pay entitlement in both Xcode and App Store Connect.
4. Rebuild and submit the app. Apple Pay activates automatically once the merchant ID is configured.

### App Store Notes

- Apple Pay will activate when a valid merchant ID is added.
- You must enable the Apple Pay entitlement in Xcode and App Store Connect.

## App Store Prep Checklist

- Ensure privacy policy and terms links resolve correctly.
- Provide a support URL and compliance details in `assets/app-store-info.md`.
- Capture final screenshots in `assets/screenshots/` before submission.
- When answering Apple's cannabis questionnaire, include your state license number and confirm sales occur only where legal.

## Local Dev Quick-start

```
cp .env.example .env   # fill keys
npm run dev:emulators  # Firestore/Auth/CF
npm run dev:expo       # Expo client against local emu
```

## Custom Dev Client

Generate native projects and build a custom development client:

```bash
npx expo prebuild
npx expo run:android   # or npx expo run:ios
```

## Push Notifications Setup

1. Add your Firebase config files:
   - Place `google-services.json` in `android/app`.
   - Place `GoogleService-Info.plist` in the iOS project.
2. **iOS:** Enable Push Notifications and Background Modes (Remote notifications) in Xcode. Upload your APNs key to Firebase.
3. **Android:** Confirm `google-services.json` is present and Firebase Messaging is referenced in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
4. On launch the app requests notification permission and logs the FCM token. Replace the sync stub in `App.tsx` to send the token to your backend if needed.
5. Send a test message from the Firebase console to verify foreground, background, and quit-state behavior.
