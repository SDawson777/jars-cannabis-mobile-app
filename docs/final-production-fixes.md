# Final Production Fix Summary

## Context

During final QA we found that the offline cart queue only replayed when network
connectivity changed. If a shopper queued actions while already online (for
example, quickly adding an item after a transient disconnect) the queue stayed in
AsyncStorage until connectivity flipped again. That left the backend cart out of
sync with what the user saw locally.

## Fixes Implemented

- Refactored `useOfflineCartQueue` to centralize queue flushing in a
  `processQueue` callback that is reused by the effect, the NetInfo listener, and
  the queuing helper.  
- Added immediate replays when the device is online: after pushing a payload into
  storage we now check connectivity and flush right away instead of waiting for a
  future network event.  
- Hardened queue processing to discard empty arrays, keep the queue intact when a
  replayed request fails, and always reset the `pending` flag appropriately so the
  UI reflects real state.

## Validation Guidance

1. Install dependencies if they are not present (`npm install`).
2. Run the targeted tests:
   ```bash
   npm test -- src/__tests__/useOfflineCartQueue.test.tsx backend/tests/cart.update.test.ts
   ```
3. (Optional) From a running dev build, toggle airplane mode to enqueue a cart
   update, then disable airplane mode—the update should post immediately without
   needing an additional reconnect cycle.

## Additional Notes

- No schema or API changes were required; the fix is isolated to the mobile hook.
- Jest may not be available in clean environments until dependencies are
  installed—ensure `npm install` has run before executing the validation command
  above.
